## 🚧 Under Active Development

VoiceEval is currently in **early development**. We're building the world's most comprehensive voice AI testing framework—**making voice agents reliable, testable, and production-ready**.

**⭐ Star this repo** to follow our progress and get notified when we launch!

## What is VoiceEval?

VoiceEval is an open-source testing framework built specifically for voice AI agents. As voice AI systems become critical business infrastructure, testing them manually doesn't scale—edge cases slip through, latency issues compound across the ASR-LLM-TTS pipeline, and there's no standardized way to measure quality.

VoiceEval solves this by providing developers with comprehensive automated testing tools: measure transcription accuracy (WER), validate conversation flow, test task completion, monitor latency, and evaluate response quality using LLM-as-judge validation. All with familiar pytest-style workflows and seamless CI/CD integration.


### Key Features (Coming Soon)

- ✅ **Comprehensive Metrics**: WER, latency, task completion, conversation flow
- ✅ **LLM-as-Judge**: Intelligent evaluation using GPT-4, Claude, local LLMs
- ✅ **Pytest Integration**: Familiar testing workflow developers already know
- ✅ **CI/CD Native**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins ready
- ✅ **Enterprise Ready**: SOC2 compliant, self-hosted options
